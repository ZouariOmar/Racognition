## Key Features

- üëÅÔ∏è Face Detection with Haar Cascade: Utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier for efficient and reliable face detection in both images and video streams.
- üß† Face Recognition with LBPH: Implements the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm for face recognition‚Äîknown for its simplicity, speed, and accuracy in various lighting conditions.
- üé• Real-Time Recognition: Supports live video input via webcam or camera feed, allowing for real-time face detection and recognition.
- üì∑ Image & Video Compatibility: Capable of processing both static images and video files for facial analysis.
- üõ†Ô∏è Built with OpenCV: Entirely developed using the OpenCV library, making it lightweight and highly compatible across platforms.
- üßë‚Äçüè´ Training Interface: Includes functionality to train the system with new faces, enabling custom datasets and personalized recognition.
- üóÉÔ∏è Data Management: Stores trained data and face samples for easy updates, backups, and reusability.
- üîê Ideal for Access Control: Can be integrated into security systems for identity verification, attendance tracking, or restricted access applications.
